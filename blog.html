                    <p>
                        Books are often an integral part of our lives because they
                        provide us with education, amusement, and inspiration. But as
                        time goes on, we often find ourselves accumulating a vast
                        collection of old books that we no longer need or use. So at
                        some time, we tempt to dispose of these books by just selling
                        them to a scrap dealer.

                        If you are reading this blog post Where and how to sell old books
                        online in India, I suspect you too do not want to throw away your
                        old books and of course, you don’t either want to sell your old
                        books to the local scrap dealers too. This thinking has an obvious
                        reason behind. Why will you sell your used books to a scrap dealer
                        for a few rupees as you probably had bought them at good high
                        prices (maybe hundreds of rupees or even thousands).

                        Books, books are the most beautiful thing created by a man. Though
                        their size is small, but the amount of knowledge they kept in them
                        is just invaluable. Books not only provide us with knowledge, they
                        educate us, entertain us, and they also serve us as a good
                        companion when we feel alone. Irrespective of their nature whether
                        they are story books, school or college textbooks, fiction books,
                        or any other reading book, books give

                        A college is an exciting place for self-discovery and growth, while
                        time spent at college is full of memory and joyful experience for
                        every student. And for the same reason, the average person thinks
                        that a student’s life is easy to spend. But that’s the one side of
                        the coin, the other side is not much thriving as this. College-going
                        students have to deal with some common problems.

                        quite difficult to buy study materials when they move to their new
